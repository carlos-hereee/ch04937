### Hi there, I'm [Carlos Hernandez](https://www.carloshernandez.tech/)

- Full stack web developer from Houston, Texas
- I'm currently learning everything!

From the first line of code to last project I worked on as well as new technologies to new best practices; there's always something more for me to learn. That's what I love the most about being a developer!

The break in my portfolio was due to the inability to repair my computer due to unforseen circumstances outwith my control.  Please ask if you require any further information about this break.

👇🏻 Here is a list of projects I work on: 👇🏻
